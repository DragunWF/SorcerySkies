# SorcerySkies

## Description

Play as a mage in a 2D world, dodging spikes and fireballs falling from the sky while collecting coins and diamonds along the way.

The goal in this game is to survive for as long as you can; this is a bullet hell game. **Difficulty scales**; the longer you survive, the more projectiles spawn in the game over time. Avoid spikes and fireballs; obtain coins and diamonds for extra points.

You can use your **WASD keys or arrow keys to move**.

This game is my submission to [GameDev.tv's 2023 game jam](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-jam-2023).

## Other

I didn't have much time to make this because the game jam was on my examination week but I did it regardless because it's fun and I want to improve.
